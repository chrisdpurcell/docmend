# Project Status

This is the human-facing completion summary for docmend. Agents maintain it so the project builder can re-orient quickly.

## Completed

- Adopted four Project Standards (python-tooling, markdown-tooling, project-spec, adr) — CI gates green; Markdown Frontmatter Standard deliberately not adopted (ADR-0001).
- Spec `docs/specs/docmend.md` (SPEC-VHHB, `full` profile) is implementation-ready: entire decision backlog settled (RQ-001..033, zero blocking), ADR set 0001–0017 accepted, 71-gap register fully dispositioned, traceability drift-check CI gate live.
- Branch/CI/CD workflow live (ADR-0017): protected `main`, merge-commit PRs from long-lived `dev`, five required checks + dependency-review license gate.
- **MS-0 Foundation implemented** (2026-07-06, PR #5): `docmend` CLI entry point with the IR-005 global flags, strict §18.2 TOML config loading, structlog logging framework with the run-ID convention, NFR-005 purity enforcement wired before any transform exists, §16 license record.
- **MS-1 Core workflow implemented** (2026-07-06, PR #6): `docmend scan PATH` produces the schema-validated DR-001 inventory — provably read-only, include/exclude filters, single-pass classification (BOM/UTF-8 facts, newline census, hard-link and symlink records), single-file PATH first-class. The four OQ-004 artifact JSON Schemas are pinned in `src/docmend/schemas/` (adr-0005). 125 tests, 97% branch coverage.
- **MS-2 Domain logic implemented** (2026-07-06, PR #7): `docmend plan PATH` produces the schema-validated DR-002 plan — fact-gate ladder (filters, hard-link, oversize, encoding gates), content pass (decode checks, transform prediction, EC-005 shrink-invariant guard, collisions, C.4 decision provenance, per-action UUIDv7 identities). Pure transforms (FR-007–FR-009: encoding, newline, whitespace) live behind the adr-0016 file-class dispatch, enforced NFR-005-pure. `charset-normalizer` legacy detection rung populates DR-001 at scan. Initial weird-document corpus + regression harness, including the three-axis encoding-floor boundary matrix; RQ-022 MS-2 calibration checkpoint executed — floor stays 20. Post-merge housekeeping (same day) cleared every deferred review minor: enum drift guard, purity-fixture hardening, defensive decode catch, symlink filter labeling, stale-size fast-fail, plan-shorthand exit coherence, byte-exact-fixture guards (.prettierignore + markdownlint ignore). 345 tests, 98% coverage.
- **MS-3 User & admin experience implemented** (2026-07-07, PR #9, merged to `main`): the writer layer (atomic writes, verify-then-mutate backups, fsync-per-record NDJSON manifest, adr-0004 safety gate) + `docmend apply` (dry-run default, FR-003 hash guard) + `docmend restore` (LIFO manifest replay, mode-preserving) + flock run lock; the §18.6 restore drill proves plan→apply→restore byte-identity. 526 tests, 97% coverage.

## Current State

- The tool can inventory, plan, modify, roll back, and verify: `scan`/`plan`/`apply`/`restore`/`verify` are all live. **MS-4 Unattended operation is in progress.**
- Spec is `status: draft`, revision 0.17. Three open questions, all non-blocking (implementation proceeding on their recorded assumptions): OQ-034 (default artifact/log location — `./.docmend/`), OQ-035 (preservation CLI surface + risk tiers), OQ-036 (flock run-lock location/mechanism — its apply-vs-restore lock-key gap is now fixed). Owner sign-off wanted.
- **MS-4 progress:** ✅ OQ-036 lock-key gap closed (manifest schema 1.2 `source_root` + restore lock rekey); ✅ `docmend verify` (FR-014/IR-004 — read-only UTF-8/LF content checks + manifest after-hash reconciliation, 0/1/2 exit taxonomy). Remaining: resume (FR-013), idempotency (FR-017), single-file verify journey (NFR-006), verify report/count reconciliation. Work sits on `dev`, 3 commits ahead of `main`, not yet in a PR.

## Recent Changes

- [2026-07-07] MS-4 (in progress): `docmend verify` (content checks + manifest reconciliation) and the OQ-036 lock-key fix (manifest 1.2 `source_root`); spec rev 0.17; 545 tests.
- [2026-07-07] MS-3 merged (PR #9 → `main`); a housekeeping pass fixed a `collapse_blank_lines` phantom-blank-line edge case and cleared two false-positive PR review threads (PEP 758 3.14 syntax).
- [2026-07-07] MS-3: writer layer (atomic writes, backups, manifest, safety gate) + apply/restore commands + flock run lock + restore drill; schemas 1.1; both MS-2 review Importants closed; spec rev 0.16.
- [2026-07-06] MS-2: plan command + planning layer + pure transforms + charset-normalizer legacy detection + weird-document corpus; RQ-022 calibration checkpoint (floor stays 20); spec rev 0.15.
- [2026-07-06] MS-1: scan command + discovery layer + pinned artifact schemas; new OQ-034; dependency-review purl exemption for rfc3987-syntax (false GPL detection, verified MIT).
- [2026-07-06] MS-0: CLI entry point, strict config, logging framework, purity enforcement; dependency licenses recorded.
- [2026-07-06] Branch/CI/CD workflow adopted (ADR-0017); third consistency audit brought all four spec gates green (spec v0.12).
- [2026-07-05..06] Spec authored to implementation-ready: decision backlog RQ-001..033, ADRs 0001–0016, gap register dispositioned (detail: `docs/handoff/sessions/2026-07.md`).

## Notes For The Builder

- Read `docs/specs/docmend.md` (Appendix B) before proposing any implementation — it is a binding Agent Implementation Contract, not just background.
- Milestone order (spec §19) is binding: do not build a later milestone on an unproven earlier one.
- Run `scripts/check_traceability.py` after any edit to the spec or the question files; CI enforces it.
- All changes go `dev` → PR → `main`; direct pushes to `dev` do not run CI — run the local gate first (see README).
